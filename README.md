# CustomerComplaints_Analysis

Project Description:

Introduction:

Comcast Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider committed to enhancing customer experiences, embarked on a data-driven journey to decipher the voices of its valued customers. In an era where customer satisfaction stands as a paramount benchmark of success, understanding and addressing customer concerns is not just a priority but a strategic imperative.

Aim:

The primary aim of this project is to gain profound insights into customer feedback and complaints, thus empowering Comcast Telecom to elevate service quality, enhance customer satisfaction, and cement its reputation as a customer-centric telecommunications leader.

What to Achieve:

Through rigorous analysis of a vast dataset of customer complaints and feedback, we aim to achieve several key objectives:

Identify Geographic Patterns: Discern geographical clusters where Comcast Telecom faces the highest number of complaints. This understanding will drive the formulation of region-specific strategies.

Temporal Insights: Recognize temporal trends in complaints to allocate resources efficiently, ensuring a proactive response during peak periods.

Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Investigate satisfaction rates in conjunction with complaint data. The goal is to pinpoint areas where improvements can be made to elevate overall customer satisfaction.

Topic Modelling: Utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to categorize complaints into topics, allowing for a deeper understanding of prevalent themes.

Document Clustering: Implement K-Means clustering to group similar complaints together, enabling more focused analysis and targeted interventions.

Recommendation Formulation: Based on the insights gained, develop actionable recommendations that encompass region-specific strategies, improved complaint resolution processes, resource allocation during peak hours, and quality control measures.

Strengthen Customer Relationships: Ultimately, this project seeks to strengthen customer relationships by addressing concerns and improving the overall customer experience for companies.
